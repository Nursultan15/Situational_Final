Greetings and welcome to the machine learning introduction Presentation! Specifically designed for novices, this talk goes over the basic ideas of machine learning, such as variables, loops, and functions. This lecture provides a strong foundation for anyone wishing to get started in machine learning or programming, regardless of experience level.

## Overview:
With the use of advanced technology, computers can now learn from data and make judgments or predictions without needing to be explicitly programmed thanks to machine learning. With an emphasis on variables, loops, and functions—the fundamental building blocks of any machine learning workflow—this talk seeks to introduce the fundamental ideas of machine learning.

## Examples
Examples from real-world situations are given to show how machine learning ideas are used in real-world situations. To illustrate how variables, loops, and functions are implemented in Python for machine learning tasks, snippets of code and demos are given.

## Quizzes:
Throughout the lecture, there are quizzes to gauge how well the audience has understood the subject matter. These interactive tests promote involvement and support the reinforcement of learning goals.

## Tasks :
